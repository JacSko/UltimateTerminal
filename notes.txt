1. Command input should have a dropdown menu with recent commands
2. UserButton must implement some functions like wait(), maybe even 'for' loops?
3. Commands that are executed on port open event, maybe even close?
4. LoggingSettingDialog::Settings::getPath() should not use hardcoded slash (it is OS specific, but not needed until windows support ready).
5. DONE - Button to stop scrolling to latest trace in command window
6. External window with custmizable traces (regexp)
