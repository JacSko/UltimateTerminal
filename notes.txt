1. Command input should have a dropdown menu with recent commands
2. UserButtons implementation
3. UserButton must implement some functions like wait(), maybe even 'for' loops?
4. Commands that are executed on port open event, maybe even close?
5. LoggingSettingDialog::Settings::getPath() should not use hardcoded slash (it is OS specific, but not needed until windows support ready).
6. Serial baudrates shall be fixed
